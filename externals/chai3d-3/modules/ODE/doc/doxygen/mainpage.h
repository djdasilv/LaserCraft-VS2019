\mainpage Introduction

This module is an extension to the core CHAI3D framework that incorporates
support of the Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) developed by Russel Smith. \n

For a general introduction to the ODE libraries, we recommend to review the 
documentation and examples that are available on the official ODE website. \n

See <a href="http://www.ode.org" target="_parent">www.ode.org</a> for more information about ODE.

See <a href="http://www.chai3d.org" target="_parent">www.chai3d.org</a> for more information about CHAI3D.

<b> IMPORTANT NOTE: the online documentation for the CHAI3D libraries is 
a continuous work-in-progress. </b> \n
Although the large majority of classes have been documented properly, there 
might still be some poorly documented items. If you happen upon an 
undocumented or poorly documented class and / or class method which you 
find hard to understand, please give us a notice so we can rectify the 
situation.
