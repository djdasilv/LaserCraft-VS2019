\mainpage Introduction

This module is an extension to the core CHAI3D framework that incorporates
support for spring based deformable models (GEL).\n

See <a href="http://www.chai3d.org" target="_parent">www.chai3d.org</a> for more information about CHAI3D.

<b> IMPORTANT NOTE: the online documentation for the CHAI3D libraries is 
a continuous work-in-progress. </b> \n
Although the large majority of classes have been documented properly, there 
might still be some poorly documented items. If you happen upon an 
undocumented or poorly documented class and / or class method which you 
find hard to understand, please give us a notice so we can rectify the 
situation.
