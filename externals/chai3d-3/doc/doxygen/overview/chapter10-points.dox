\page chapter10-points Point Clouds



\section section10-1 Introduction

A point cloud is a set of data points in a three-dimensional coordinate system. 
In CHAI3D, these points are defined by X, Y, and Z coordinates, and often are 
intended to represent the external surface of an object.

Point clouds may be created by 3D scanners. These devices measure a large number 
of points on an object's surface, and often output a point cloud as a data file. 
The point cloud represents the set of points that the device has measured. 



\section section10-2 Point Cloud Objects

Similar to mesh objects, point cloud models use vertices to describe all the points 
that compose the cloud. A finger-proxy algorithm is also used to compute all
the interaction forces between the haptic tool and the object. A collision
detection must also be initialized after all points have been created.


@code

    using namespace chai3d;
	
    // create a virtual mesh
    cloud = new cMultiPoint();

    // add object to world
    world->addChild(cloud);

    // load point cloud
    cloud->loadFromFile("myPointCloud.obj");

    // create collision detector
    cloud->createAABBCollisionDetector(toolRadius);

    // set point size for graphic rendering
    cloud->setPointSize(5.0);

    // set haptic stiffness
    cloud->setStiffness(0.2 * maxStiffness, true);

    // enable display list for faster graphic rendering
    cloud->setUseDisplayList(true);
