\page chapter2-installation Installation



\section section2-1 Download

The latest version of the software can be downloaded from the CHAI3D website.

- Open a browser to the following webpage: <a href="http://www.chai3d.org/download/releases" target="_blank">www.chai3d.org/download/releases</a>.

\section section2-2 Development Tools

\subsection subsection2-2-1 Windows

The recommended development environment under Windows is Microsoft Visual Studio.
CHAI3D supports editions 2012, 2013 and 2015.

CHAI3D is compatible with the community edition of Visual Studio 2015, 
which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs" target="_blank">www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs</a>.

CHAI3D also supports the Express Edition of Visual Studio, 
which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-express-vs" target="_blank">www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-express-vs</a>. 



\subsection subsection2-2-2 Linux

Alongside the standard development packages specific to each Linux distribution, some additional
development packages need to be installed to build CHAI3D. These packages include support for
USB communication, sound output, and OpenGL GLUT display libraries:

- libusb-1.0 development package 
- ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) development package
- FreeGLUT development package

Below is the name of these packages for some popular Linux distributions:

- __ubuntu__
 - libusb-1.0-0-dev
 - libasound2-dev 
 - freeglut3-dev 

- __fedora__
 - libusbx-devel
 - alsa-lib-devel
 - freeglut-devel 

- __openSUSE__ 
 - libusb-1_0-devel
 - alsa-devel 
 - freeglut-devel 

__NOTE:__
In order for your application to connect successfully to your USB haptic device, 
please make sure to run your CHAI3D applications with super user privileges (sudo).



\subsection subsection2-2-3 Mac OS X

CHAI3D requires version 10.12 (Sierra) of the operating 
system to be installed as well as the latest version of XCode. More information 
can be found on the Apple website: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode" target="_blank">developer.apple.com/tools/xcode</a>



\section section2-3 Graphic Drivers

CHAI3D uses the OpenGL framework to perform 3D graphic rendering. Under the Linux 
and Mac OS X operating systems, OpenGL drivers are provided by default. If you are
using Windows and have installed the operating system directly from a Microsoft Windows 
Installation CD or DVD, you will need to update your graphic drivers by downloading 
a fresh copy from the website of your graphics card manufacturer.

If you card is an ATI or an NVIDIA model, you may find a link to their website here:

- NVIDIA: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com" target="_blank">www.nvidia.com</a> 
- ATI: <a href="http://www.amd.com" target="_blank">www.amd.com</a>

Note that Microsoft only provides an emulated version of OpenGL using DirectX. 
Therefore if you are encountering any performance issues with the graphic rendering,
OpenGL drivers are among the first things to check. 



\section section2-4 Installing Haptic Devices

CHAI3D currently supports the following commercial haptic devices:


\subsection subsection2-4-1 Force Dimension

The Force Dimension family of force-feedback interfaces include the omega.x, delta.x and 
sigma.x haptic devices. \n 

On Linux and Mac OS X platforms, the libraries required to support Force Dimension devices
are included with CHAI3D so there is nothing else to do.

On Windows, please download the latest drivers from the Force Dimension support website: 
<a href="http://www.forcedimension.com/support/download" target="_blank">www.forcedimension.com/support/download</a>


\subsection subsection2-4-2 Novint Technologies

Support for the Falcon haptic device is provided by the Force Dimension drivers.

On Windows, please download the latest drivers from the Force Dimension support website: 
<a href="http://www.forcedimension.com/support/download" target="_blank">www.forcedimension.com/support/download</a>

If you were previously using the Novint drivers, please carefully follow these instructions:
- Uninstall all software provided by Novint. Carefully follow all instructions that may be displayed on the screen during uninstallation.
- Download and install the Force Dimension drivers for your Windows architecture (32- or 64-bit) from the Force Dimension website.
- Restart your computer.
- Connect your Falcon haptic device.

If the Falcon device is not detected, you will probably have to manually force the Force Dimension driver to be installed on the Falcon device.
Please follow these instructions:

- Control Panel -> System -> Device Manager
- Select "Falcon" device
- Select thumbnail "Driver"
- Select "update driver"
- Select "Browse my computer for drivers"
- Select "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer"
- Choose the latest driver (Force Dimension), and you should be ready to go!


\subsection subsection2-4-3 3D-Systems

The supported haptic devices include the Phantom Omni, Phantom Desktop, and Phantom Premium (6-DOF).

Please contact 3D Systems to obtain a copy of their latest Windows drivers and a copy of OpenHaptics 3.0 or higher.

If you wish to use two Phantom devices simultaneously (Windows only), please make sure that you name 
the second device as "Phantom2". This operation is performed in the main Phantom Configuration Panel
program.

\subsection subsection2-4-4 Leap Motion

The only supported device is the Leap Motion Controller.

Please please download the latest drivers from the Leap Motion website: 
<a href="https://developer.leapmotion.com/" target="_blank">developer.leapmotion.com</a>


\subsection subsection2-4-5 Sixense

The only supported device is the Razer Hydra.

Please please download the latest drivers from the Sixense website: 
<a href="http://sixense.com/sixensecoreapi/" target="_blank">sixense.com/sixensecoreapi</a>

In order to enable Sixense device support in CHAI3D, you will need to uncomment the following flag in
the global relevant operating system section of the configuration header file \ref CGlobals.h "CGlobals.h":

@code

    //--------------------------------------------------------------------
    // HAPTIC DEVICES
    //--------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    #define C_ENABLE_SIXENSE_DEVICE_SUPPORT

@endcode
