\page chapter1-introduction Introduction

\section section1-1 Foreword

The following manual was designed to give the reader an overview of the 
organization and fundamental components that make up the CHAI3D framework. 
We advise the reader to use this tutorial in combination with the various 
examples that have been extensively documented inline.



\section section1-2 Background

CHAI3D (Computer Haptics and Active Interface) is an open source set of C++ 
libraries for computer haptics, visualization and interactive real-time 
simulation. Originally started at the <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu" target="_blank">
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a> at <a href="http://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank">
Stanford University</a>, CHAI3D was developed to provide a simple and compact 
framework for introducing experimental haptics to the research community. 
With further contributions from EPFL in Switzerland and the University of 
Siena in Italy, the first public version of CHAI3D was released in 2004. 
Written entirely in C++, CHAI3D was designed to make it easier and more 
intuitive for developers to create applications that combine 3D modeling 
with force-feedback rendering capabilities. By supporting different types 
of force-feedback devices, CHAI3D offers a unique interface to easily 
design and deploy advanced computer haptic applications.

Over the years, CHAI3D has grown to become one of the most popular open 
source multi-platform haptics rendering frameworks, and has been used in 
a large number of research and production projects, in such diverse areas 
as games, simulators, educational software, interactive art, scientific 
visualization, and medical applications. 



\section section1-3 Capabilities

CHAI3D combines an extensive number of force rendering algorithms, including 
the finger-proxy model, potential fields and implicit based models which allow 
programmers to easily develop sophisticated simulations with integrated 
haptic capabilities. The framework also provides the necessary data 
structures required to create multi-level scene graphs which carry static, 
dynamic and articulated bodies. A lightweight OpenGL-based graphics engine 
provides the foundations for easy rendering of virtual environments using 
dedicated 3D graphic acceleration hardware. Object meshes, implicit shapes, 
volumes, surface materials and texture properties are all represented in 
well organized classes that can easily be extended by the programmer to 
incorporate more advanced or application-specific features. CHAI3D also 
provides support for importing 3D files from professional applications such 
as Autodesk 3D Studio Max and Alias Wavefront.



\section section1-4 Modules

Support for third party components is achieved through organized extension 
modules that independently complement the capabilities of the CHAI3D core 
elements. Extension modules include wrappers for the ODE and GEL dynamics engines,
making it possible to simulate rigid and deformable bodies in real time. CHAI3D 
also supports various commercially-available three-, six- and seven-degree-of-freedom 
haptic devices, and makes it simple to support new custom force-feedback devices. 
Thanks to its lightweight and modular architecture, CHAI3D can easily be combined 
with third party libraries including graphics or dynamics engines.


\section section1-5 Operating Systems

The CHAI3D framework is supported under the following operating systems: 

- Microsoft Windows  
- Linux
- Apple Mac OS X
