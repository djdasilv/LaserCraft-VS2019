\page chapter22-faq Frequently Asked Questions

\section section22-1 Haptic Devices


\subsection subsection22-1-1 Why is my Phantom haptic device not detected?

Make sure that the drivers and the OpenHaptics SDK are correctly installed on 
your computer. Use the demonstration applications provided by 3D Systems to verify if 
your device is calibrated and correctly operating.


\subsection subsection22-1-2 How can I use two Phantom devices with CHAI3D?

Only the Windows drivers can support multiple Phantom devices. In order to
configure a second device, please review the installation chapter about
3D System. 


\subsection subsection22-1-3 Why is my Novint Falcon haptic device not detected?

Support for the Novint Falcon requires installing the drivers from Force Dimension.
please review the installation chapter for more information. 


\subsection subsection22-1-4 Can CHAI3D support my custom made haptic device?

If you have designed your own haptic device, you can easily interface it to 
CHAI3D by completing the template found in file <b>src/devices/CMyCustomDevice.h/.cpp</b>
Simply follow the instructions included in the template.




\section section22-2 General


\subsection subsection22-2-1 How to upgrade from CHAI3D 2.0 to 3.0+?

We suggest that you carefully review the many new examples provided with the 
framework as these demonstrate how to use all the latest functionalities. 
Earlier examples found in CHAI3D 2.0 have also been ported to the latest 
version, and therefore these examples will give you a good idea on how to 
update your code.


\subsection subsection22-2-2 Why is my application crashing when rendering graphics?

First check that the OpenGL drivers have been correctly installed on your computer.
For that we suggest that you review the chapter about the installation.

CHAI3D 3.0 also relies on the GLEW library (OpenGL), and therefore it is important to 
always initialize GLEW at the beginning of you application by calling <b>glewInit()</b>.
Check the examples and templates for more information.


\subsection subsection22-2-3 Is CHAI3D supported under Qt or .NET?

Yes Qt and .NET are supported. While all examples have been written using FreeGLUT, 
we have included templates for Qt and .NET as well. These can be found in the 
<b>./templates</b> directory. 


\subsection subsection22-2-4 Is CHAI3D free?

The latest version of CHAI3D is free and is released under the BSD license. 
Please note that if you are planning to commercialize your application, you 
are responsible for not infringing on any patents owned by third party companies 
or academic institutions.


\subsection subsection22-2-5 Can I contribute to CHAI3D?

Yes of course! If you have found some bugs, improved the documentation, or 
perhaps developed a new module, please contact us. (support@chai3d.org)



\section section22-3 Support


\subsection subsection22-3-1 Where can I find documentation about CHAI3D?
