\page chapter3-organization Organization



\section section3-1 Introduction

In the following sections we provide a brief description of the organization 
of the most important files and directories that compose CHAI3D.



\section section3-2 Main Directories


\subsection section3-2-1 ./src

This directory contains the entire source code of the CHAI3D core framework.
We will come back to that one in the \ref section3-2 "Source Code" section where
we will explore the organization of the difference source files.


\subsection section3-2-2 ./external

This directory contains source code to third-party libraries that are used by 
CHAI3D. Some of these libraries can be enabled or disabled by selecting the
desired options in file \ref CGlobals.h


\subsection section3-2-3 ./modules

This directory contains all third party extension modules for CHAI3D. 
The default modules that come with CHAI3D are the <a href="../../modules/ODE/doc/documentation.html">ODE</a>
wrapper for the open source dynamics engines <a href="http://www.ode.org" target="_blank">ODE</a>, the 
<a href="../../modules/GEL/doc/documentation.html">GEL</a> framework for modelling deformable bodies and the
<a href="../../modules/V-REP/doc/documentation.html">V-REP</a> plugin for
the <a href="http://www.coppeliarobotics.com" target="_blank">Coppelia Robotics V-REP simulator</a>.
Each module shares a similar structure that include the source files, project files, examples, 
and documentation.


\subsection section3-2-4 ./lib

This directory contains the CHAI3D library files that result from compiling 
the CHAI3D source code.


\subsection section3-2-5 ./examples

This directory contains the project files and source code for the various 
examples provided with CHAI3D.


\subsection section3-2-6 ./bin

This directory contains the executable files that result from compiling 
CHAI3D with all of its examples. You may also find in that directory dynamic 
library files (.dll or .dylib) which support third-party haptic devices. A <c><b>resources</b></c>
directory also includes all the media files that used by the different examples.
 
 
\subsection section3-2-7 ./doc

This directory contains all documentation related to CHAI3D. The documentation
is generated using <a href="http://www.doxygen.org" target="_blank">Doxygen</a>
and is provided inlined in every source file of the framework.

 
\subsection section3-2-8 ./templates

This directory contains three different project templates that use GLUT, Qt,
and the Microsoft .NET frameworks. These templates are very useful if you want to 
create a new project from scratch.


\subsection section3-2-9 ./extras

This directory contains additional third-party libraries that are used by the examples 
provided with CHAI3D. They are not required to build the CHAI3D core library, but are
necessary for the CHAI3D example executables to build and run properly.


\subsection section3-2-10 ./utils

This directory contains utilities that convert font and images to source code that
can be included and built into CHAI3D.

 
 
\section section3-3 Source Code

The source code is located in the \ref section3-2-1 "/src directory". It contains the main 
\ref chai3d.h header file and a set of subdirectories with all the source files organized
by topic.


\subsection section3-3-1 ./src/audio

This directory contains all the files that provide sound support to CHAI3D.
Details are available in the \ref audio "audio" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-2 ./src/collisions

This directory contains the files that handle collision detection between rays and
geometrical primitives such as points, lines, and triangles. 
Details are available in the \ref collisions "collisions" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-3 ./src/devices

This directory contains support for all supported haptic devices.
Details are available in the \ref devices "devices" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-4 ./src/display

This directory contains files related to framebuffers and virtual cameras which are
used to render scenes of the world in viewports or window displays.
Details are available in the \ref display "display" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-5 ./src/effects

This directory contains all the classes that model haptic effects (e.g friction, 
vibration, surfaces, etc...) Details are available in the \ref effects "effects" 
section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-6 ./src/files

This directory contains support for loading and saving 3D models, 2D images, 
2D videos, and audio files. Details are available in the \ref files "files" 
section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-7 ./src/forces

This directory contains classes that implement force rendering algorithms such 
as potential fields and finger-proxy based methods. Details are available in the
\ref forces "forces" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-8 ./src/graphics

This directory contains all files related to graphic support. These include 
support for videos, fog, fonts, images, image arrays, videos, etc... Data structures
for handling arrays of points, segments, and triangles are also included.
Details are available in the \ref graphics "graphics" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-9 ./src/lighting

This directory contains all classes for modelling light sources and shadows.
Details are available in the \ref lighting "lighting" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-10 ./src/materials

This directory contains all classes for modelling materials and textures. 
Details are available in the \ref materials "materials" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-11 ./src/math

This directory contains the basic code for handling 3D vectors, matrices 
and quaternions. You will also find a number of functions for performing simple 
geometrical computations. Details are available in the \ref math "math" section
of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-12 ./src/resources

This directory contains a collection of files for precompiled fonts and shaders
that are used for graphic purposes. Details are available in the \ref resources "resources"
section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-13 ./src/shaders

This directory contains all classes for supporting vertex and fragment shaders.
Shaders are used for implementing advanced graphic rendering effects.
Details are available in the \ref shaders "shaders" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-14 ./src/system

This directory contains several useful classes for handling strings, 
mutexes, and threads. Details are available in the \ref system "system" 
section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-15 ./src/timers

This directory contains classes that model a precision clock and frequency 
counters for accurate time measurement. Details are available in the 
\ref timers "timers" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-16 ./src/tools

This directory contains classes that implement haptic tools which connect
haptic devices to avatars that interact with objects in the virtual environment. 
Details are available in the \ref tools "tools" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-17 ./src/widgets

This directory contains different classes for rendering 2D widgets such 
as text labels, dials, bitmap images, scopes, etc...
Details are available in the \ref widgets "widgets" section of the documentation.


\subsection section3-3-18 ./src/world

This directory contains the classes that are used to compose and describe
a 3D scene. These include the world itself, shape primitives, meshes, volumes, and other 
3D entities which can be rendered both graphically and haptically.
Details are available in the \ref world "world" section of the documentation.
