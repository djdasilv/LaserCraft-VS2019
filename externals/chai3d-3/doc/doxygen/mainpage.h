\mainpage Introduction

CHAI3D is an open source set of C++ libraries for computer haptics, 
visualization  and interactive real-time simulation. CHAI3D supports 
a number of commercially-available three-, six- and seven-degree-of-freedom 
haptic devices, and makes it simple to support new custom force feedback 
devices.

For a general introduction to the CHAI3D libraries, we highly recommend to 
review in numerical order the well documented examples provided with the 
framework.

For overviews of various selected features or general organization of 
CHAI3D, see sections <a href="overview.html">overview</a> and <a href="modules.html">documentation</a>.

This online documentation for CHAI3D is a continuous work-in-progress.
Although the large majority of classes have been documented properly, there 
might still be some poorly documented items. If you happen upon an 
undocumented or poorly documented classes or concepts which you 
find hard to understand, please give us a notice so we can rectify the 
situation.

See <a href="http://www.chai3d.org" target="_parent">www.chai3d.org</a> for more information about CHAI3D.
