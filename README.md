# Haptic Interface Program

This program enables real-time teleoperation of a **Force Dimension Delta 3 robotic platform** using a **Sigma 7 haptic device** as the master controller. The system is designed to manipulate a **glass or silica sample** in 3D space relative to the **focal point of an optical system** that includes a **near-infrared (NIR) laser** and a **Third Harmonic Generation (THG) sensor**.

When the sample reaches the focal point, THG light is generated and partially reflected into the sensor. The sensor output, a voltage signal proportional to the THG intensity, is captured using a **data acquisition board (DAQ)** and processed in real-time. This feedback is used to generate force cues on the haptic device, guiding the user toward optimal alignment with the laser focus.

## üïπ Controls Overview

> ![Program Instructions](Haptic%20program%20instructions.png)

### Movement Control

- `x`, `y`, `z`: Lock/unlock movement on each axis (can combine for 1D constraint)
- `0`‚Äì`4`: Set scale factor between haptic device and robot (e.g., `0` = 0.001√ó)

### Scanning

- `G`, `H`, `J`: Start/stop scanning along X, Y, Z respectively
- Output: CSV file with robot position and THG signal

### Visualization & Interaction

- Arrow keys: Move camera around the center of the sampling cube
- Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out

### Sample Rendering

- `U`: Toggle sample rendering  
  - Displays test sample if <12 points  
  - Uses real sample after 12+ points from FemtoTouch setup  
- Limit: 5000 points max for real-time mesh

### Mesh Filtering (Post-Processing)

- Triangle area filter:
  - `W`: Increase area threshold
  - `S`: Decrease area threshold
- Triangle edge length filter:
  - `E`: Increase length threshold
  - `D`: Decrease length threshold
- Filtering is done using the **most restrictive** of both conditions

## üß™ Notes on Mesh Generation

The mesh is built from a point cloud where the THG signal exceeds a preset threshold. TetGen is used to convert this point cloud into a tetrahedral mesh. However:

- TetGen tries to close the mesh, sometimes adding unrealistic large triangles
- Use mesh filters (`W`, `S`, `E`, `D`) to remove such artifacts
- Increasing point count improves quality, but increases processing time
