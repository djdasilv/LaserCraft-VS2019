# Haptic Interface Program

An interactive program for controlling a robotic system via a haptic device, keyboard, and mouse. Designed for semi-automated sample scanning, real-time visualization, and 3D mesh reconstruction from THG signal data.

## üîß Features

- üéÆ **Haptic-controlled movement** for intuitive robot navigation  
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Keyboard & mouse support** for full control over scanning, movement restriction, and visualization  
- üîÑ **Semi-automated scanning** in X, Y, or Z direction with output to `.csv`  
- üñºÔ∏è **3D sample rendering** and multi-angle visualization  
- üß© **Mesh generation** using the TetGen library from collected THG point clouds  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Live mesh filtering** by triangle area and edge length for quality control

### Movement Control

- `x`, `y`, `z`: Lock/unlock movement on each axis (can combine for 1D constraint)
- `0`‚Äì`4`: Set scale factor between haptic device and robot (e.g., `0` = 0.001√ó)

### Scanning

- `G`, `H`, `J`: Start/stop scanning along X, Y, Z respectively
- Output: CSV file with robot position and THG signal

### Visualization & Interaction

- Arrow keys: Move camera around the center of the sampling cube
- Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out
- `.` (dot): Reset robot origin to current position (e.g., under laser)

### Sample Rendering

- `U`: Toggle sample rendering  
  - Displays test sample if <12 points  
  - Uses real sample after 12+ points from FemtoTouch setup  
- Limit: 5000 points max for real-time mesh

### Mesh Filtering (Post-Processing)

- Triangle area filter:
  - `W`: Increase area threshold
  - `S`: Decrease area threshold
- Triangle edge length filter:
  - `E`: Increase length threshold
  - `D`: Decrease length threshold
- Filtering is done using the **most restrictive** of both conditions

## üß™ Notes on Mesh Generation

The mesh is built from a point cloud where the THG signal exceeds a preset threshold. TetGen is used to convert this point cloud into a tetrahedral mesh. However:

- TetGen tries to close the mesh, sometimes adding unrealistic large triangles
- Use mesh filters (`W`, `S`, `E`, `D`) to remove such artifacts
- Increasing point count improves quality, but increases processing time
