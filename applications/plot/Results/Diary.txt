BigSampleX-Sweep(NotFull)_17_3_25Afternoon - Done using the big glass with stripes on it. Laser was increased to 35% efficienc, bellow this value not much could be read. Sample not fully analyzed as robot is in the way of the optic if we go all the way. 55 side up
Same for V2

BigSampleX-Sweep(Full)_17_3_25AfternoonV2 -Same as before but positioned the sample on the holder such that, full measure in the sense of the lenght could be done
BigSampleZ-Sweep_17_3_25Afternoon - Might actually be a false result  
BigSampleZ-Sweep_17_3_25AfternoonV2 - Yielded better results than BigSampleZ-Sweep_17_3_25Afternoon, z position increases but measure was done from top to bottom -> Smaller z = more on top
BigSampleZ-Sweep_17_3_25AfternoonV3 - Same as V2 on a different spot to look for differences/similarities

GlassSample_17_3_25AfternoonWithBackplate - Was done on the same 1mm thick glass sample but with the bottom side being directly touching the backplate. All the other for thin the glass sample were made with the sample hanging (I think).
